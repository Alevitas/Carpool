The first thing you must do is write a description of the trip which can be as detailed as you want. Next up is selecting the date and time. You may enter an exact address in the location field which is optional but if provided will allow you to open the location up in maps with the 'show in maps button'. Once you have filled out all of the required fields, hit confirm and the new trip will be added."

The trips screen has two options which is to view your own trips and those of your friends. To add new friends, go to the friends tab and click the plus sign. A search bar will be available for you to search for your friends name and selecting them will add them to your list. You may remove them on the friends screen by swiping left on the row."
